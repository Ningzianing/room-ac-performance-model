# Room-ac-performance-model

This repository provides a physics-based performance calculation model for residential split-type air-source heat pumps (ASHPs).

The model estimates cooling and heating performance (capacity, COP, and power consumption) under arbitrary operating conditions based on manufacturer catalog data.

# Description

The model is developed to reproduce the performance characteristics of inverter-type room air conditioners, including:

- Cooling capacity and COP
- Heating capacity and COP
- Low-temperature heating performance
