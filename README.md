# Room-ac-performance-model

This repository provides a physics-based performance calculation model for residential room air conditioners (RACs).

The model estimates cooling and heating performance (capacity, COP, and power consumption) under arbitrary operating conditions based on manufacturer catalog data.

# Description

The model is developed to reproduce the performance characteristics of inverter-type room air conditioners, including:

- Cooling capacity and COP
- Heating capacity and COP
- Low-temperature heating performance
